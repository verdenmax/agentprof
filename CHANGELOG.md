## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Skill pipeline integration (corrected layout)** — five curated skills from `github/awesome-copilot` placed at `<repo>/.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project-level path per [GitHub Copilot CLI skills docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-skills)), plus two `.instructions.md` files at `.github/instructions/`. All checked into git and propagated by `git clone` — no global install step required:
  - `cli-mastery` (Stage 4)
  - `copilot-cli-quickstart` (Stage 4)
  - `github-release` (Stage 8)
  - `create-github-action-workflow-specification` (Stage 5)
  - `create-architectural-decision-record` (Stage 2)
  - Plus `.github/skills/README.md` documenting provenance, upstream sync command, license, and verification (`/skills list`, `/skills reload`).
- **Unified 9-stage pipeline** — `.github/copilot-instructions.md` §5 rewritten as a Boot → Discovery → Decision → Planning → Implementation → CI/Infra → Debugging → Completion → Release flowchart; covers every obra + project skill with stage, trigger, output, and exit criterion.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` §6 extended: §6.1/§6.2 expanded with the five new skills and the `Pipeline 阶段` column; new §6.6 "Stage 0 常驻 instructions" and §6.7 "Skill 来源说明" (obra/superpowers global vs `.github/skills/` per-repo).
- `docs/architecture.md` §14.7 rewritten to map all 19 skills to pipeline stages and document outputs; new §14.8 acknowledging the two always-on instruction files.
- Skills usage matrix integrated into both AI and architecture docs (🔴 MUST / 🟡 recommended / 🟢 optional tiers + anti-patterns).
- Workspace skeleton with five crates (`agentprof-core`, `agentprof-adapters`, `agentprof-storage`, `agentprof-tui`, `agentprof-cli`) and an `xtask` helper.
- Architecture authority document (`docs/architecture.md`, L1).
- AI-assistant guide (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- Adapter contributor guide placeholder (`docs/adapters.md`, L2).
- L1/L2/L3 documentation system definition (see `docs/architecture.md` §14).
- Repository configuration: `rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `deny.toml`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, dual `LICENSE-*` files.
